\section sFlrigDesc Transceiver Control

FLRIG is a transceiver control program designed to be used either stand
alone or as an adjunct to FLDIGI.  The supported transceivers all have some
degree of CAT.  The FLRIG user interface changes to accommodate the degree
of CAT support available for the transceiver in use.

Three different main dialog aspect ratios can be selected to suit the
computer screen dimensions and operator preferences.  The wide aspect
ratio can be resized horizontally.  The narrow aspect ratios are fixed
in width and height.

\subsection ssXcvrSelect Xcvr Select

<center>
\image latex config/xcvr.png "I/O Ports - Xcvr" width=4.9in
\image html config/xcvr.png "I/O Ports - Xcvr"
</center>
<br>

Select the rig in use from the "Rig" combo box.

The default values associated with that transceiver will be preset for you.
These have been verified by the test team but might require some tweaking for
your particular h/w.

\subsection ssPTT Configure PTT

<center>
\image latex config/PTT-generic.png "I/O Ports - PTT" width=4.9in
\image html config/PTT-generic.png "I/O Ports - PTT"
</center>
<br>

Select CAT PTT if your transceiver supports a CAT command for PTT on/off.  This
control will default to checked if CAT PTT is supported.

You may prefer to use h/w PTT signaling instead of CAT PTT.  The h/w PTT may be
shared with the CAT serial port.  Note that both RTS/CTS handshake and RTS PTT
cannot both be used on a single serial port.

If your serial connection is a CI-V device you might need to check "Echo"
and also set either RTS or DTR to +12 if CI-V power is derived from the
serial port.

Your PTT h/w control may also make use of a second serial port.  If that port
is the secondary serial port of the SCU-17 then you must also enable the "Serial Port is SCU-17 auxiliary"
control.

\subsection ssCMEDIA Configure CMEDIA PTT

<center>
\image latex config/PTT-cmedia.png "Cmedia PTT control" width = 4.9in
\image html  config/PTT-cmedia.png "Cmedia PTT control"
</center>

Cmedia audio codec chips are used in a number of inexpensive USB audio thumbnail devices.  
It is also used in the DRA@ series of sound card adapters.  The DRA is a radio optimized 
sound card used to connect a two-way radio to a computer for digital communications. 
The DRA-Series digital radio adapter is used for Packet Radio or other digital programs 
and applications like VARA-FM, VARA-HF, SoundModem or fldigi. 

All RA Series radio adapters include GPIO support.  The Cmedia device supports 4 unbuffered 
input/output lines, GPIO-1 ... GPIO4.  GPIO-3 is used to drive a fully buffered and deadman 
protected PTT circuit.  All DRA Series radio adapters include a Heartbeat Monitor. When the 
Cmedia device is reading or writing audio data, the HeartBeat status LED (HB) flashing. If 
everything is okay, (HB LED is flashing) a Blue LED called "COMM OK" illuminates. If the HB 
LED stops flashing because the radio adapter or the computer/appliance has failed, or the 
software has stopped reading or writing audio data, the Blue COMM OK LED goes out. The Blue 
LED indicates the health status of the system, and illuminates when everything is okay.

The PTT line on any DRA Series radio adapter is interrupted with the failure of this health 
status. This function will kill the PTT line the audio stream is interrupted.  This will 
occur if fldigi and similar modem program is not reading/writing audio data.

The circuitry was designed to operate correctly no matter if the Heartbeat has stuck in the 
on or off state. 

The PTT type, the device and the GPIO line must be selected.
If multiple C-Media devices are discovered they will enumerate as C-Media-A, C-Media-B, etc.  
You must test the selected interface as it is not possible to know which is the correct one 
for the DRA interface.  Pressing the TEST button will cause the PTT line to rapidly toggle 
for a period of 2 seconds.  This will cause the RED PTT led to flash and the transceiver PTT 
to toggle on and off.

\subsection ssGPIO Use Pi GPIO PTT

<center>
\image latex config/PTT-gpio.png "GPIO PTT control" width = 4.9in
\image html  config/PTT-gpio.png "GPIO PTT control"
</center>

The Pi series of miniature computers offer a large array of possibilities for
controlling devices.  It has a array of General Purpose Input Output, gpio, 
lines of a 40 pin in-line header.  17 of these gpio lines can be used for
things like push-to-talk.  There are several add on boards for the Pi3 and Pi4,
such as the NW Digital Radio UDRC-II, that has a full interface for digital
operations, including PTT and audio codecs.

Access to hardware ports is always limited to the user who either is root 
or has root privileges.  setuid and setgid (short for set user ID upon 
execution, and set group ID upon execution, respectively) are Linux
access rights flags that allow users to run an executable with the 
permissions of the executable's owner or group respectively and to change 
behaviour in directories. They are often used to allow users on a computer 
system to run programs with temporarily elevated privileges in order to 
perform a specific task. While the assumed user id or group id privileges 
provided are not always elevated, at a minimum they are specific.

It is possible to give full gpio access and control privileges by elevating
flrig with setuid root.  But this is not advisable as flrig is also
granted access to both serial and network services.  There is a way to
provide the access via a second program that does have the elevated privilege

This is a copy of material at 

\verbatim
https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/
\endverbatim

for installing WiringPi which includes a really nice utility called gpio.

To obtain WiringPi using GIT:

\verbatim
$ git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
\endverbatim

If you have already used the clone operation for the first time, then

\verbatim
$ cd wiringPi
$ git pull origin
\endverbatim

Will fetch an updated version then you can re-run the build script below.

To build/install there is a simplified script:

\verbatim
$ cd wiringPi
$ ./build
\endverbatim

The build script will compile and install it all for you.  It does 
use the sudo command at one point, so you may wish to inspect the script 
before running it.

<b>Test wiringPi's installation</b>

run the gpio command to check the installation:

\verbatim
$ gpio -v
$ gpio readall
\endverbatim

That should give you some confidence that it’s working OK.

WiringPi is released under the GNU Lesser Public License version 3.

flrig uses the gpio program for initializing the gpio port, which also
happens to the change the privilege of the temporary sys file for setting
the port state.

<b>Read the man document for gpio</b>
\verbatim
GPIO is  a  swiss  army knife of a command line tool to allow the user 
easy access to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi and the SPI A/D and D/A 
converters on  the  Gertboard.  It's designed for simple testing and 
diagnostic purposes, but can be used in shell scripts for general if 
somewhat slow control of the GPIO pins.

It can also control the IO's on the PiFace IO board and load the SPI and 
I2C  kernel  modules if required.

Additionally, it can be used to set the exports in the /sys/class/gpio 
system directory to allow subsequent programs to use the /sys/class/gpio 
interface without needing to  be run as root."

After installing gpio on your Pi you can set the gpio port on flrig's
GPIO configuration tab.  The UDRC-II for example uses pin 16, BCM # 23,
for push to talk.  It has an LED indicator on the board to show when PTT
has been enabled.  For this board you select "BCM 23" and select the
corresponding "= 1 (on)" check box.
\endverbatim

During start up flrig uses the gpio program to set up the gpio pins with
the command 
\verbatim
$ gpio export NN out
\endverbatim
This is the command to export a GPIO pin in the /sys/class/gpio directory. 
Note  that  the  pin number  is  the  BCM_GPIO number.  'out' sets the pin
to be an output control, and 'in' an input control.

Once a GPIO pin has been exported, the gpio program changes the  ownership  of  the
<br>

/sys/class/gpiogpioX/value
<br>

and if present in later kernels, the
<br>

/sys/class/gpio/gpioX/edge
<br>

pseudo files to that of the user running the  gpio  program. This means 
that you can have a small script of gpio exports to setup the gpio
pins as your program requires without the need to run anything as root,
or with the sudo command.

During shutdown flrog uses the gpio program to disable access to the gpio
pins used with PTT by invoking the command
<br>

gpio unexport NN.
<br>

You can check that this is working correctly from a terminal window using the
command
\verbatim
$ gpio readall
\endverbatim


\subsection ssAUX Configure auxiliary ports

<br>

<center>
\image latex ui/aux-controls.png "Aux Controls" width=3.45in
\image html ui/aux-controls.png "Aux Controls"
</center>
<br>

You might also need access to special h/w functions.  FLRIG provides this
via the DTR and RTS signal lines of an independent serial port.  Additional
main dialog controls are enabled and shown if you select anything other than
NONE (the default). Enable the "Serial Port is SCU-17 auxiliary"
if you are using the SCU-17 secondary serial port.

\subsection ssPOLLING Configure Polling
<center>
\image latex config/polling.png "I/O Ports - Polling" width=4.9in
\image html config/polling.png "I/O Ports - Polling"
</center>
<br>

Providing you transceiver supports the various meters and controls, you
can elect to poll these every time the poll cycle occurs.  Polling a value
causes FLRIG to follow and well as control a particular transceiver function
or control.  The polling cycle will slow down as you elect to poll more and
more values.

\subsection ssSENDING Send Command String

<center>
\image latex config/send.png "I/O Ports - Sending" width=4.9in
\image html config/send.png "Sending"
</center>
<br>

Testing your transceiver commands.  FLRIG might not support a particular CAT
command for your transceiver.  You can test the support for a particular
command using the "Send Cmd" tab.  The command string must comply with the
transceiver requirements.  If ASCII text is used, as with transceivers based
on the Kenwood command set you enter the string without spaces, i.e.

\verbatim
FA;
\endverbatim
to read the A vfo .

For binary strings, used in older Yaesu transceivers, and all Icom CI-V type
transceivers you need to enter the string as space delineated hex values,
i.e.

\verbatim
Yaesu:  x00 x00 x00 x01 x05

Icom: xFE xFE x70 xE0 x1A x05 x00 x92 x00 xFD
\endverbatim

The buttone "ICOM pre" and "ICOM post" will insert the preamble and postamble
hex code sequences for the selected Icom transceiver.

Press the SEND button to transfer the command to the transceiver.  The
response will appear in the lower text control.

The diamond indicators will be lit for transceiver and fldigi connections respectively.

\subsection ssTRACE Configure Command Tracing

<center>
\image latex config/config-trace.png "Configure code execution trace" width=5.0in
\image html  config/config-trace.png "Configure code execution trace"
</center>

Several debugging tools are available in flrig, including the ability to observe code
execution in various parts of the program.  The trace tool sends time annotated data to
both a viewing dialog and a file named "trace.txt" which is written to the flrig files
folder.

<ul>
<li> Trace support code - main processing loop execution points</li>
<li> Trace debug code - replicate the event log debugging output</li>
<li> Trace rig class code - execution points within a specific transceiver class (not for all)</li>
<li> Trace xml_server code - execution points within the xmlrpc interface code for i/o to/from fldigi</li>
<li> Trace xmlrpcpp code - sent and received xmlrpc data packets<br>
six levels of detail 0 ... 5 can be specified</li>
</ul>

\subsection ssRESTORE Configure Read/Restore Xvcr Settings

flrig will read various transceiver parameters and restore them upon closing.
The next image shows the available read/restore parameters for the Icom 7200.  If
a parameter is not available (or coded) it will be disabled and grayed out.  Check
each parameter that you want to read and restore.  Reading and restoring transceiver
parameters takes time, especially on older transceivers with low baud rate serial
i/o.  Check "Use xcvr data" i\If you want flrig to NOT change the transceiver operating state
when it begins execution.

flrig accepts remote control via an XmlRpc socket interface.  fldigi uses this 
access method for reading and writing transceiver parameters via flrig.  WSJT-X and
several other third party programs also use this method.  See \ref xmlrpc_commands.

You can control the behavior of both the average and peak values of the
S-meter and Power out meters.  Setting the controls to 1 for both average
and peak will simply display the latest value available from the
transceiver.  The average setting results in the display showing the
average of the last N readings.  The peak value will display the average
peak value over the last M readings.

dialog.  Each of the 4 scales and the "Auto scaled" box are buttons.  Press
the one you want to use.  Auto-scaling adjusts the meter scale to the
smallest scale consistent with the current measured peak power.  If that
power is fluctuating near the transistion point between two scales you
might want to fix the scale to either the larger or smaller.
<br>

\subsection ssSliders Slider sizing

When the user interface is configured to be "small" then the UI submenu will
contain the item "Small sliders".  Toggling this menu item will immediately
change the size and positions of the various slider controls. Select the toggle button

\section sOpControls Operating Controls

<center>
\image latex ui/frequency-control.png "Frequency Control" width=4.6in
\image html ui/frequency-control.png "Frequency Control"
</center>
<br>

The frequency display is also a control.  The control must have "focus" for the user
to make changes.  The control has focus whenever the mouse cursor is over it.  The foreground and background
colors reverse to indicate the control has focus.  Moving the cursor outside the control releases focus.

<br>
<center>
\image latex ui/frequency-control-focus.png "Frequency Control - vfoA has focus" width=4.6in
\image html ui/frequency-control-focus.png "Frequency Control - vfoA has focus"
</center>
<br>

The number of digits that may be entered and the number of decimal digits displayed
are determined by hard-coded data for the rig selected if using rig control.  The intent
is to match the actual rig display.

If you select NONE for rig control, 7 digits to the left of the decimal and 3 digits
to the right are displayed (display is in kHz).

In the rig control case, the maximum frequency is determined by the rig; in the NONE
case, the maximum frequency is 9,999,999.999 kHz.

The maximum frequency <B><I>based on the number of digits displayed</I></B> is given in the tooltip.

Each digit is sensitive to the mouse.  Clicking the left or right button over
the top half of a digit increments it while clicking over the lower half decrements it.
Holding the mouse button down will cause the number to rapidly increase or decrease.  Alternatively,
you can roll the mouse wheel with the pointer over a digit and it will scroll the digit.
In all cases the numbers "roll over" - i.e., you can change the digit you point to
and all digits to the left of it.

Arrow and Page Up / Page Down Keys can be used to increment and decrement digits.
Digits are numbered 0-9, right to left, with the digit's significance matching that of the rig's display.
For example, if the rig's resolution is 1 Hz, D0's range is 0-9 Hz.

All of the foregoing change techniques result in immediate changes to the
frequency of a controlled rig.

There are two additional ways to set the frequency: <B>PASTE</B> and <B>direct keyboard entry</B>.  In
both cases, make sure the flrig main window has focus (click in title bar) and then
move the mouse cursor inside the Frequency Control window to
give it focus (colors will reverse).

You can paste from the clipboard (Ctrl-v)
or from the Selection buffer (middle mouse button).  The selection must be from text within
the application whereas the clipboard paste will paste values copied from any application.
The value pasted is assumed to be numeric in units of kHz and can include a decimal point.
If the value being pasted would exceed the maximum frequency allowed, the Paste action is silently ignored.
The Paste action results in an immediate command to set the frequency on a controlled rig.

Lastly, you may enter a frequency directly from the number keys or keypad of a keyboard.
Enter the frequency in kHz, including decimal point if there are non-zero decimal components,
using either the number keys or the keypad.  You may use any legal floating point format.
For example:

<ul>
<li>7070
<li>14070.235
<li>1.4e4
</ul>


When you press the first number, the decimal point in the display will blink to indicate
you are in numeric entry mode.  While in numeric entry mode, all other entry modes are
disabled (i.e., no mouse clicks, rolls, or pastes are possible).

Continue to enter numbers, and optionally a decimal and more numbers.  The value does NOT
get sent to a controlled rig until you press the ENTER key.  Pressing the ENTER key
sends the value to the rig and exits the numeric entry mode.

If you want to make changes as you are entering numbers, you can use the backspace key
to delete undesired numbers digit by digit, or Ctrl-Backspace to clear all digits,
and then resume entering numbers.

If you attempt to enter more digits on either side of the decimal than there are
digits available, the excess digit entries are ignored.

If you want to abort the process you can press the ESC (escape) key or move the cursor
out of the Frequency Control and the frequency will remain as it was; this exits numeric entry mode.

Vfo-A and Vfo-B are separate controls, A on the left, B on the right.  If your radio has
two VFOs, you can make one or the other active for transmission and reception by clicking
on the corresponding button.  Note that many radios allow you to change the frequency of
an inactive VFO through remote command, in which case you do not have to click on the
corresponding button to set its frequency.

Left click on the A/B button to swap several of the parameters of the VFOs (e.g., frequency,
filter setting, mode) and change the active VFO to follow (so effectively your operation
has not changed but you are using the other VFO).

Shift-click to copy just the frequency from Vfo-A to Vfo-B, and Ctrl-Click
to copy in the other direction.

The buttons that have a light box are toggles - activated when the lighted
box is colored.  Some of these are linked to a slider.  If the button state
is inactive then that associated slider will be greyed out.  In the example
the volume control is active and the NR control is inactive.

Operating FLRIG with FLDIGI requires a simple setup in FLDIGI.  Deselect all
but the "xmlrpc" rig control.  Xmlrpc is used via a local socket device for
the two programs to communicate.  FLDIGI acts as the server and FLRIG the
client.  There is no requirement for start / stop ordering of the programs.

FLRIG sends rig configuration data to FLDIGI when the two programs initially
recognize each other.  This data is used to populate the rig name, the
available modes and the available bandwidths.

After this initial communications the operator can set the paired controls
from either FLDIGI or FLRIG.  The two programs will remain synchronized.  The
data from the computer to the transceiver is always from FLRIG.

PTT can be activated at FLRIG or using the T/R button on FLDIGI.  FLDIGI
also engages the PTT via the macro \<TX\> \<RX\> tags.  When operating digital
modes with FLDIGI you should use the PTT from FLDIGI.

\section sFileStores Configuration/Data files

Configuration and data files used by flrig consist of the following:

(1) Several TRANSCEIVER.prefs and mat files may be in the folder.  Each specifc to the configured transceiver<br>
(2) Files such as IC-7100.prefs.1, IC-7100.mat.1, up to a prefix of 5 may appear in the folder.  These are aged files, with the oldest
file having the largest prefix value.  The mat files are only created if the user actually saved items to memory.

Transceiver Prefs details are shown in this file: \ref prefs_file_contents.

The file is human readable.  Editing the file is not recommended.

\subsection sMatFile  Memory File

Operating frequency, mode, and bandwidth can be saved to a memory file.  Save the current values to the 
memory file using the "Memory / Save" menu item.  Open the memory manager using the
"Memory / Manage" menu item

</center>

The "Add", "Pick", "Del" and "Clr" buttons operate as labeled.

Left click on a line to enable modifying the Tag line for that entry.  Terminate the tag entry with the "Enter" key.

The contents of a typical transceiver .mat file contains:
<br>
<pre>
020000 2 5 "40 CW"
7070000 11 16 "PSK sub band"
7089000 11 16 "Feld Hell net"
</pre>
Each line contains a frequency (Hz), Mode Nr., Bandwidth Nr., and "text tag"

The file is human readable.  Editing the file is not recommended.

<br>

The event log is opened from the "Debug" menu.  It allows you to view the
serial and xmlrpc data exchanges between FLRIG, FLDIGI, xmlrpc transactions,
and the transceiver.


\section ssMultipleConfigDir Controlling Multiple Transceivers

You can have multiple instances of flrig running, each controlling a separate
and unique transceiver.  Doing this requires a separate configuration folder
for each target transceiver.  Either start flrig from a command line or
copy the desktop launch icon and then modify it's "target" executable.  In
either case you will be adding a command line parameter

"--config-dir <target-dir>"

Note the double dash.  The <target-dir> will be unique to each supported
transceiver, for example: "C:\Users\<user-name>\flrig.ic7200" on Win-10, 
"/home/<user>/flrig.ic7200" on Linux or OS X.  You will have to configure
each instance with the correct interface parameters.
