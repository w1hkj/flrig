FLRIG provides a full implementation of all TT550 control functions including
the operation of the Model 302 remote keypad.  The TT550 selection can also
be used with the TT538, Jupiter.  The Jupiter emulates all of the Pegasus
commands.

All of the FLRIG "front panel" controls operate the same as for any other
transceiver with a few exceptions.  The Pegasus does not have any preamp
control.  So that button is converted for use as a spot control when the
rig is in CW mode.

Select CW mode and then press the spot button.  You should hear the sidetone
(if not you may need to increase the Spot Vol ... see below).  You can then
adjust the B (BFO) control for the desired sidetone frequency.

The DIGI mode is unique to FLRIG and the TT550.  The control commands
available on the Pegasus allow the program to control the center
frequency and the bandwidth for all of the DSP filters.  The DIGI
mode is designed to always place the center frequency of the filter
at 1500 Hz.  When FLRIG is used with FLDIGI this provides a very
convenient and easy way to QSY to a received signal and then narrow
down the filter.  The Pegasus DSP filters are very well suited to digital
mode operations.

Selecting the TT550 from the rig selection combo box should preset all of the
interface controls.  You should only need to select from the serial port
combo.  FLRIG will find all unused serial ports so be sure that the TT550
is not being accessed by another software when you start FLRIG.

It is necessary to press the Init button when you first set the program for
use with a transceiver.  Subsequent use should not require any action on
the part of the operator.


The TT550 has it's own set up dialog for accessing those controls that are
not routinely used.  This dialog is opened by the "Config / Xcvr setup"
menu.

\section sAdditionalControls  Additional Control

Access to the additional controls is obtained by the down arrow button to
the left of the Att control.

\subsection ssCW CW

The internal keyer can be enabled and both the words/min and the weight of
the keyer can be adjusted.  The Pegasus is a QSK rig and you can adjust the
QSK hold in milliseconds.  You can adjust the keyer sidetone volume relative
to the received audio.  Set the control to zero if you do want to hear the
sidetone.  The Spot Vol control is associated with the Spot button on the
front panel.  This volume is also relative to the receiver volume control.

\subsection ssVOX VOX

You can operate the Pegasus with manual SSB PTT or with Vox.  The three
Vox controls are controlled IAW the 550 manual.

\subsection ssSpeech Speech

</center>
<br>

You can monitor the SSB speech level (recommended only with headphones).
The compression level is also adjustable and speech compression can be
enabled or disabled as suited.

The Accessory socket line out level can be set to prevent overdriving of
a terminal node controller or computer sound card interface.  The front
panel NB, noise blanker, control can be set for any level from NONE to
7.  AGC can be set for slow, medium or fast.  The transmitter can be
disabled.  Very useful if you do not want idle hands pressing the PTT
switch.  The Tloop (for amplifier) can be enabled and finally if your
Pegasus has the built-in tuner it can be bypassed.


\subsection ssAudio Audio

<br>

Audio can be either from the Mic connector or from the Accessory input
(digital mode ops).  The level of the line out on the remote connector can
be controlled independent of the speaker.

\subsection ssRX RX

The signal frequencies internal to the Pegasus are all derived from a single
oscillator.  That oscillator can be corrected for frequency error using the
VFO adjustment control.

\subsection ssTX TX

302 Keypad Accessory  If you have the 302 keypad you can set various
parameters to adjust it's performance.  The function keys can be assigned
on of several response functions:

</center>
<br>

Both the Pegasus and the Jupiter can be controlled with the Model 302 key
pad / encoder.

As you enter keypad values from the keypad they will appear in an entry
box at the upper right of the main dialog.  These are used for entering
a frequency in kHz (i.e. 14.070 MHz is entered as 14070.000).

Here the numbers 1 and 4 have been pressed in sequence.  You can abort the
input by pressing the decimal value twice in succession.  You can also set
a time out in seconds.  Failure to continue an entry within the time out
period will also abort the input.
